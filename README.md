### Requirements

#### Please create an app for managing tasks.
 The user can input a text and click Add
- A new task is added with the title, and 00:00 time, and a play button.
- Clicking Play will play this task: the timer will start running, and the icon will change to a pause icon.
 Also - any other running task will be paused.
- Clicking Pause will pause the task.
- The total time is always updated.
- Please implement the redux state, actions and reducers. If you have time - implement the UI as well using >React / Angular (no need for fancy HTML/CSS).
